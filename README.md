# NMED3720-WebExtensions

Bitter is an extension built to alter Twitter's interface based on the amount of engagement a tweet receives. Tweets are obscured depending on how many likes they have in relation to others on the page. While this alone should highlight what tweets to pay attention to (especially when viewing a tweets replies), the extension also boosts the font size of tweets given the amount of replies they have to their likes. Styling can be toggled and customized within the extension's plugin menu, with settings saved locally to the browser.

Last, but certainly not least, the extension replaces Twitter's new X logo with its former one. Out of all the changes this extension make's, this by far makes the greatest improvement to the user experience. Just ignore how the bird is upside down for the time being; we're bringing down some oxygen to revive it.

I don't use social media. I tend to keep to myself, often disappearing off the face of the internet until I have something to release. The problem is this doesn't mesh well with the algorithms that platforms are built off of. They expect a continuous stream of content, even if it's nothing more than [word salad](https://personmeetup.github.io/NMED4520-FontAnimation/). You're expected to contribute to this maddening dance, where in exchange you'll be acknoledged by others. Spew forth, and recieve murmurs of endorcement. From my experience, however, it's incredibly easy to get burned by that dance. 

Watching from the outside, platforms like Twitter don't feel like the global town squares they're made out to be. They seem more like mosh pits, where everyone is either fighting one another or trying to get others attention. It doesn't help how conversation on the site is steered whatever are the most popular thoughts, leaving everything else hidden and obscured. That's the experience I wanted to highlight with this extension: how conversations seem to gravitate towards what's bitter.
